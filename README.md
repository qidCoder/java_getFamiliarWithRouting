## Getting Familiar with Routing
For this assignment, you are going to practice routes in Spring Boot. The goal is to master writing method level ```@RequestMapping``` annotations and ```@RequestMapping``` class level annotation

**Objectives:**

   * Practice creating a Spring Boot application.
   * Practice @RestController annotation
   * Master @RequestMapping.
    
**Tasks:**

   * Create a controller named 'CodingController'. For the first 3 routes, use the ```@RequestMapping``` annotation.
   * Have an http GET request to 'http://localhost:8080/coding' display a text that says 'Hello Coding Dojo!'.
   * Have an http GET request to 'http://localhost:8080/coding/python' display a text that says 'Python/Django was awesome!'.
   * Have an http GET request to 'http://localhost:8080/coding/java' display a text that says 'Java/Spring is better!'.
   * Create another controller named 'DojoController'. For the routes below, use the ```@PathVariable``` annotation.
   * Have an http GET request to 'http://localhost:8080/dojo' display a text that says 'The dojo is awesome!'.
   * Have an http GET request to 'http://localhost:8080/burbank-dojo/' display a text that says 'Burbank Dojo is located in Southern California'.
   * Have an http GET request to 'http://localhost:8080/san-jose/' display a text that says 'SJ dojo is the headquarters'.
